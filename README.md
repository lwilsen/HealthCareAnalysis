# HealthCareAnalysis

This is a forked repo of Renu Ghering's HealthCareAnalysis that was created with the intent of testing data science methods on synthetic Medicare and Medicaid data.

I'm going to be exploring this data based on her teaching's as a part of an independent study for my Master's in Biostatistics.
